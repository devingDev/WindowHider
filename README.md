# WindowHider

Hides Ghidra main window. idk why you can't do that by default. 
annoyed me to have the extra window always in taskbar and alt tab all the time without ever using it except for opening the the binary in codebrowser at the start.
and if you close it? it closes the code browser too...

Can use it for any window but you have to compile with your window title (and maybe should make it load that dynamically..)
